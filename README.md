# Environment Files  
This is a repository of environment specifications for things like `conda`, `pip`, `virtualenv`, etc. These will allow you to run most code in the project.

* [Conda](#conda-envs)

## Conda envs
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) is a great python distribution for data science. The package manager `conda` makes it easy to install packages, even ones with pesky dependencies. The conda env [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) has installation and management instructions.  
Conda environments:  
* [geospatial](./conda/geospatial_env.yml) - A fairly comprehensive geospatial environment for python, including `geopandas` and `osmnx`, with all dependencies.
